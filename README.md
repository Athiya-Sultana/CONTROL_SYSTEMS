Implementation Process:
            First, the system is analyzed to understand its dynamics and parameters. Next, the system is modeled using transfer function or state-space representations with tools like MATLAB or Python. The control algorithm is then designed based on system requirements, using techniques such as PID control or Model Predictive Control (MPC). The algorithm is implemented and tested in a simulation environment to verify performance. Comprehensive testing is conducted to ensure the system meets performance criteria like stability and accuracy. Tools such as MATLAB, Simulink, or Python libraries aid in modeling and analysis, while real-time processing may involve sensors and actuators.
